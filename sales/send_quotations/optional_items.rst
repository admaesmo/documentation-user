Add optional products
=====================

The use of optional products is a marketing strategy for cross-selling products along with a core
product. The aim is to offer useful and related products to your customers. For instance, if a
customer wants to buy a car, he has the choice to order an automatic opening trunk and massaging
seats, or not to order such high quality products and simply buy his car.

Add optional products to your quotation templates
=================================================

Be sure to check out our documentation about :doc:`quote_template` to understand how you can
enable, create, design and manage your own quotation templates before reading this part.

For each template, you have an **Optional Products** tab where you can add related products or
services.

Add optional products to your quotations
========================================

For your information, you can also add or modify optional products directly on quotations. Indeed,
when customers open a quotation from a received email, they can easily add different optional
products to their order.

The product(s) will be instantly added to their quotation when clicking
on any of the little carts.

Depending on your confirmation process, they can either digitally sign
or pay to confirm the quotation.

Each move done by the customer to the quotation will be tracked in the
sales order, letting the salesperson see it.
